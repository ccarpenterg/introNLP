Introduction to NLP with Deep Learning
======================================

### 1) Introduction to NLP and Word Embeddings

### 2a) Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks

In this notebook, we build and train a shallow neural network for the sentiment analysis of the IMDB Reviews Dataset. Since regular neural networks are not designed for processing sequences of vaiable length, we use the Gloval Average Pooling to convert sequence of vectors into a vector of the sequence's average. In this manner, we turn every IMDB review into a vector that represents.. This average vector is then fed to a neural network with three layers: input layer, hidden layer and output layer.

The last layer contains only one neuron, and it represents the probability for a particular IMDB review to be positive. This last layer uses sigmoid as the activation function.
